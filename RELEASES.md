# Release strategy

The project will create a new release following a new Eclipse Release. The pattern is **\<year\>-\<month\>**. The plan is to publish an ADT bundle release a few days after the Eclipse release.

Any bug or additional feature like a new plugin will trigger a new minor release. The pattern used is **\<year\>-\<month\>.\<number\>**

Example: for Eclipse 2025.12, the ADT bundle will publish the corresponding 2025.12 release.

Following this release strategy, it will be possible to easily identify the Eclipse version the bundle build is using.

The list of planned Eclipse releases and their release dates is [here documented](https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/.github/blob/main/wiki/Simultaneous_Release.md).
