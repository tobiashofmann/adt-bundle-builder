# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

The ADT Bundle Builder builds an Eclipse with ADT and additional ABAP plug-ins. It is therefore relying 100% on other software. As the IDE is still going to be used in a crucial step in the software development process, I take security serious. 

If you find a security issue, please check with the provider of the used software. This can be:

- GruntJS
- Eclipse
- SAP for ADT
- Any other ADT add-on provider (SAP or open source)
- ...

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version is supported regarding security findings. The latest released version is also determined by the latest Eclipse release. A fixed version will be published to a supported release only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT file a public issue to report a security vulberability. Use instead the GH Repo report a security in private feature. This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that are found can be disclosed responsibly to any affected parties.

**Note:** for security issues found in one of the used projects of the ADT bundle builder, please do **not** report an issue here. Report it at the project for the included component.
